# Rimworld Event
This is a guidebook to the Rimworld event.
You will not be told everything there is to know: some of that is up to you to discover.
The point of this guide is to give you enough information to not die immediately.

Good luck out there. You'll need it.

## Things to be aware of
There is a lot of hacks and weird technical stuff being used to get this event to work.

First of all: this is technically an enormous station. Station grids can be destroyed.
I've tried to mitigate this where I can, but if there's a hole, [bold]Ahelp it![/bold]
RCDs are also prevented from working due to the fact they can put holes in the ground.

Also, the entire map is bounded by special invulnerable, impassable objects.
If you find one, don't bother trying to break through, it's not possible.
You can easily identify these by looking for the word 'dense X' where X is some object.
