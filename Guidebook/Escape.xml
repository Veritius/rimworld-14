# Escaping the planet

## The Wormhole Generator
To escape, you must build, activate, and defend a wormhole generator.
This is the [color=gold][bold]primary win condition[/bold][/color].

To build the Wormhole Generator, you must obtain four unique components.
You will have to leave the safety of your base of operations to find them.
It's strongly recommended to organise expeditionary teams to find these artifacts.

  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WormholeGenPartPowerCell" Caption="zero-point energy cell"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WormholeGenPartMapData" Caption="subspace map data"/>
</Box>

Once you have obtained these parts, you can begin building the Wormhole Generator
using the construction menu. It's under the Objective tab, or just search for the name.
You should build it somewhere defensible, ideally in the heart of your base of operations.

## Homesteading
Instead of building the wormhole generator, you can opt to stay on the planet and establish a settlement.
This is an [color=gold][bold]alternative win condition[/bold][/color] and is not easy. To win, you have to eliminate
[color=red]all threats in the area![/color] This involves entering the nest/base and destroying the core structure.
These threats won't go down easily, so if you want to do this, you'd better be really, really prepared.
