# rimworld-14
Rimworld event content that is intended to be prototype uploaded. Should be usable with any modern downstream of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/).

This is not magic and requires active admin intervention to make sure everything is working as intended (for example, the gateway win condition is triggered manually by admins.)
